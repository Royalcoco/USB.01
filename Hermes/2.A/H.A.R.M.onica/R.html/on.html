        - `getline` is a  GNU extension to POSIX. It reads an entire line from
            input into a dynamically allocated buffer, up to a specified maximum
            length or until EOF is reached. If the line exceeds the given limit, it
            will allocate a larger buffer and continue reading until EOF is reached.
            This function returns the number of characters read from the buffer (not
            including the null terminator), or -1 if there was an error.

        - `strtonum`, `strtofnum`, and `strtopnum` are used by libc++ when
            parsing string representations of numbers. They take a pointer to a
            null-terminated string, a pointer to a char where any excess input.
            Afterwards, `*endptr` points at the first character beyond the end of
            the parsed value. These functions return the numeric value, or +/- HUGE_VAL
            on overflow.
