            input into a dynamically allocated buffer, up to a specified maximum
            length or until EOF is reached. If the line exceeds the given limit, it

            parsing string representations of numbers. They take a pointer to a
            null-terminated string, a pointer to a char where any excess input.
            Afterwards, `*endptr` points at the first character beyond the end of
            the parsed value. These functions return the numeric value, or +/- HUGE_VAL
            on overflow.
